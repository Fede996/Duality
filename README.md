## Description

This videogame was developed for Game Design & Gamification course at Politecnico of Torino.

Here are a few lines from the game's pitch document:

We want players to cooperate and compete in a fast-paced gameplay, operating on
interdependent decisions and, engaging them in selfish vs “good of the team” decision
making.

The game includes procedurally generated dungeons, diverse mechanics, and a
progression system.

Like The Binding of Isaac, with two players controlling the same character, in an alien
invasion scenario, on PC
